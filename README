NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::TimeRequests - log how long requests take and which
    routes are slow

DESCRIPTION
    A simple Dancer plugin to log how long each request took to process, and
    also to gather stats on the average response time for each route - so
    you can see at a glance which routes are taking longer than you'd like,
    therefore where you ought to start looking to improve performance.

    Provides a statistics page giving you a list of your routes, along with
    their response times.

SYNOPSIS
    In your Dancer app, load this module:

        use Dancer::Plugin::TimeRequests;

    Then, when your app is logging in debug mode, log messages will be
    generated showing how logn each request took:

        Request to /foo completed in 4.0011 seconds in ....

    To see which routes are slow, hit the URL `/plugin-timerequests'.
